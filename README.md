        :warning: I recommend turning off the invite sniper for now as it will lock your account behind a phone/email verification screen or get it terminated.

#### How to obtain your token

https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/wiki/Obtaining-Token-and-Channel-IDs#how-to-get-a-user-token

# Tips

- Try to get a low latency to discord servers as there can be competition with other snipers.
- This is technically a self-bot: mentioning this in a discord chat is enough to make your account reportable to Trust & Safety.
- Running more than one instance or different snipers is an easy way to get your account deactivated.
- Before using, consider the moral implications of stealing gifts from communities you have nothing to do with.
